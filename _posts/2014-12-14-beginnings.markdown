This is going to be a dreadful blog.

I should probably back up. This is the online home of Thomas Beirne, web developer and generalist 
[nerd](http://thenerdrealm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nerdsblue-lowres.jpg). Along with hosting
basic info like my résumé and about page I shall also be blogging here about whatever hits my fancy.
Most of my posts will probably be about technical things but I will likely also post about leading
people effectively, running pen and paper RPG sessions, participating in community theater, and
a myriad of other niche topics.

One of the cardinal rules of blogging is to focus sharply on one topic. This allows you to market to
a core demographic, build up a following, etc. It's excellent advice. That said, at the moment my
goal is not to build up a following, but to simply get in the habit of writing. I will be writing
about whatever strikes my fancy, whenever said fancy strikes. It'll be disjointed and sporadic, but
hopefully at least occasionally illuminating.
