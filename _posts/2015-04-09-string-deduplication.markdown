I wrote a simple algorithm for removing duplicate strings from an array while maintaining ordering. You can check out the source code and readme [on GitHub](https://github.com/hankmccoy/email-deduplication). I implemented this as a very simple React app using Babel and core-js for ES6 transpilation and webpack for script and style bundling.

<div class="deduplication-app-container" style="max-width:500px"></div>
<script src="https://raw.githack.com/HankMcCoy/email-deduplication/master/dist/bundle.js"></src>
