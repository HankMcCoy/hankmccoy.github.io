I've put together a few trainings over the years.

* [Git basics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XW3vkiFaHgD0q5CElGI1Tm_4OsrR3Fz08d327ZJGC6s/edit?usp=sharing)
* [JavaScript](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UJI86XO1mhirNzfferJmszWG32b0nE1OgQw3g5dA7gs/edit?usp=sharing)
* [The Future of the Web](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nICnEH5NN4Q59tMO1DHl5_JI0kN9KjRtO99ct5GIr8k/edit?usp=sharing) (note: I'm not quite as gung-ho about web components as the future of web development as I was at the time I wrote this)
