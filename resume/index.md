## Why you should care

I perpetually seek out new ways to be better at what I do. I delight in the
low-level details of how complex (or better yet, unexpectedly simple) software
systems work. I take pride in helping others to grow and in being spurred on to
growth by them. I strive to build elegant useful products that put users first.
I'm smart and I get things done.
